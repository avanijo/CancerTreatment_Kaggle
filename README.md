**Introduction**

A cancer tumor can have thousands of genetic mutations. Distinguishing the mutations is a major challenge.
Doing this interpretation manually is very time consuming.

**Objective** of this problem is to develop algorithms to classify genetic mutations based on clinical evidence (text) given in the dataset provided on Kaggle.
